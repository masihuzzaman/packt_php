//In this exercise, we will simply iterate through a while loop to print numbers 1 through 10 and will apply a condition expression to check the numbers are within a range of 1 to 10 as we will be incrementing the number by 1
$number = 1;
while ($number <= 10) {
    echo $number . " ";
    $number++;
